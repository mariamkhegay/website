   <h1 >DESIGN</h1> 
   <p>This website is about design and all aspects of it. It is a blog 
       for designers where anyone can find a relevant information about the works they are doing.
       This website is not commercial it is public. 
       I decided to run this website and create a big platform where anyone can feel comfortable
      to share the ideas and look for inspirations. On this website you can find works of different photographers,artists and videos about ard and design.
      The aim of this website is to combine different sorts of artists and perform an outstanding collection!
